## Introduction



## Upgrade

If you have DB migration issues you may manually update some system tables. 
See if you have any table without the underscore and rename them to the following.

```mysql
-- NOTE: This has to be run manually before upgrading to ver 3.2
RENAME TABLE _migration TO _migration;
RENAME TABLE _data TO _data;
RENAME TABLE session TO _session;
RENAME TABLE _plugin TO _plugin;
```
Also check your src/config/application.php file and ensure that there are no manual
overrides for this table as you may get unexpected results
